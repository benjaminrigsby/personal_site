This page has a bunch of info about stuff that I own and use a lot. 
I've mostly put things that I recommend on this page, 
and tried to provide useful feedback/advice wherever 
possible. I constantly look for gear, tools, and systems 
to smooth out the day-to-day bumps in my life. 
Hopefully this page gives you some useful ideas or 
inspiration in that regard.

# Hardware Gear
## Tech
- **Laptop** - Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 (Intel i7, 256GB storage, 16GB RAM)  
  _Great laptop that still feels and looks good 4yrs later. Recommended._
- **Tablet** - Google Pixel Tablet
- **Phone** - Samsung S23 Ultra  
  _I like Spigens cases for all my phones. Cheap cases that do what they're supposed to._
- **Watch** - Samsung Galaxy Watch 6
- **Desktop** - i7 12700K, RTX3080, 32GB RAM
- **Monitors** - LG 34in ultawide, 1440p; LG 29in ultrawide, 1080p  
  _For my personal use I think 34in is the maximum that is useful. I think there are a few cases where a larger monitor (e.g., 49in ultrawide) could be useful eg if you are comparing many things at once in tab or tabular form, but for most cases I recommend 34in. I would recommend getting a 3440x1440 monitor if you go this large. The pixel size would be a bit too large if you chose 1080p at this screen size Also not that at 34 the vertical height of the monitor is the same as a 27" 16:9 monitor. I use a vertical dual monitor stand which I like a lot better than having side-by-side monitors. The stacked layout makes the upper monitor less intrusive I can have things up there for occasional reference that aren't nearly as visually distracting but are still near._  
- **Keyboard** - Logitech G610 (mechanical, Cherry MX Brown switches)
- **Mouse** - Logitech G502 X Lightspeed Wireless
- **Headphones** - For Computer: Logitech G PRO X Wireless; In-ear: Samsung Buds 2; Wired over-ear: Audio Technica ATH-M40x (recommended)

## Backpacks
- **Thule Stravan backpack**    
  _Good backpack water resistant decent layout. I recommend for build quality but not for form._
- **Adidas Sackpack**    
  _These are the premium versions of the inexpensive sackpack category without the premium price. Highly recommended. I really like these when on vacation and for day trips._

## Furniture
- **Desk chair** - Steel Series Leap V2 (from Crandall Office Supply)  
  _GET A GOOD CHAIR! When the pandemic hit, I started spending double digit hours in my desk chair everyday. After a few months of back pain, I decided to bite the bullet and upgrade._
- **Desk** - IKEA butcherblock countertop on some ALEX drawers
