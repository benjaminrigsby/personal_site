This page has a bunch of info about stuff that I own and use a lot. 
I've mostly put things that I recommend on this page, 
and tried to provide useful feedback/advice wherever 
possible. I constantly look for gear, tools, and systems 
to smooth out the day-to-day bumps in my life. 
Hopefully this page gives you some useful ideas or 
inspiration in that regard. 

This page was inspired by [Alexey Guzey's similar page](https://guzey.com/tools-gear/).

     - I really like Onshape and I recommend it for most casual users or beginners who ask me
     - The one downside I've run into is that simulations like a static stress analysis are a little more clunky here as compared to Fusion 360 and others
 - [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) (free for educational / personal use)
     - Interface is nice, and I was able to pick it up quickly

     - Local install which is kinda clunky but its what it is

     - Saves a short video of whatever is on your screen

# Organizing my life
I put "used since" labels in this section because recommending an organization tool necessitates an in-depth endorsement

- **Note taking app** - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) (used since 2019)  
  _Notion is a very flexible and powerful tool, but it is a blank slate. It's free for personal use. I've written about Notion resources and 5 useful Notion pages that I use all the time._
- **Task manager** - [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) (used since 2017)  
  _Todoist is a task manager todo list software that has just the right amount of functionality. So many other task managers that I've tried are clunky and beg for a lot of overhead but Todoist is designed to minimize that. I've been a pro subscriber for several years so there isn't much of a bigger endorsement I could give than that._
- **Better bookmark manager** - [Raindrop.io](http://raindrop.io/) (used since 2020)
    - General Free aesthetically pleasing multiplatform
    - Allows you to have layers of structure collections of folders
    - Icons on folders
    - Tags for bookmarks
- **Podcast app** - [PocketCasts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/) (used since 2019)
    - Podcast app
    - There are other podcast apps that are nice but this one has a great interface, low price $0.99/month, great syncing across devices, autodownload for subscribed podcasts, and has a great web interface
- **Article reader** - [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) (used since 2016)
    - Free though there are functional limits to the free version; mainly that you only get 3 highlights per article
    - Strips the junk, ads, overblown styling etc. out of articles/webpages
    - Helps organize articles by using tags and archiving for later reference
    - The downfall of this tool for me is becoming overzealous with saving interesting articles... "Oh that would be cool to read. looks interesting. Let me save it."
- **Cloud storage** - Google Drive (used since 2013)
  - Use Google Docs or Sheets instead of Word or Excel whenever possible Why Because they're free and more flexible use on any device easily collaborate and they autosaves to the cloud
    - Set up Google Backup and Sync or whatever Googles desktop to cloud sync is currently called There are a few types of files that don't play well with Google Drive auto syncing but I've never had any major issues on any of the projects/files that I use Google Drive for which is basically everything
