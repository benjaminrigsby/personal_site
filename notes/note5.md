If you don't listen to podcasts, start immediately! Podcasts allow you to regain some lost time due to driving, cleaning, washing dishes, walking, etc., etc.

I recommend you start with a podcast on something you're really interested in. Don't start with something work/school related unless you are actually interested in that topic. Make it easy to start a podcast habit. Find a good podcast app that alerts you when podcast has a new episode and auto downloads the episode so you can listen anywhere.

Suggestions for what to start with: The Daily, Business Wars, Radiolab, or Freakonomics

Here's what I listen(ed) to:

**News**

- _The Daily_: The only news I consume. 20-30 mins each morning directly from the reporters: not news commentary.

**Narrative**

- _Business Wars_: An amazingly produced show about big business clashes in US history. HIGHLY recommended!
- _Serial_: Deep dive into riveting stories. Serial does not regularly put out episodes, so the 3 seasons are it.
- _S-Town_: From the makers of Serial...it's a unique story about a guy from the south. Worth the listen.
- _Revisionist History_: Malcolm Gladwell's podcast...need I say more?
- _More Perfect_: Deep dive into Supreme Court cases.
- _Radiolab_

**Primarily Interview**

- _Making Sense_: I pick and choose episodes. Sam interviews people on a variety of topics (politics, religion (atheist perspective), science, etc.). His perspective is rational thought, free will is an illusion, meditation. In my opinion, an excellent thinker.
- _The Tim Ferriss Show_: I pick and choose episodes. Tim interviews people on a variety of topics (self help, business, etc.). His perspective is hustle, get the most out of life, etc.
- _Freakonomics_: Really enjoyed "The Secret Life of a C.E.O." episode series
- _Work Life with Adam Grant_: Many interesting episodes. Start anywhere.
- _The Next Big Idea_: Cool ~30 min interviews with authors of exciting new nonfiction.

**Comedians**

- _Joe Rogan_ (although Rogan is really all of the above)
- _Tigerbelly_
- _Kill Tony_

I can't think of a category for this podcast, which bothers me... Decided I was over thinking it.

- _not overthinking_: Two brothers think through different everyday life topics they face/wonder about (mostly relevant to young professionals).
